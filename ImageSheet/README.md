# Image Sheet Project
This is an example project I made to show how image sheets work in Corona.

### Disclaimer
I don't own any of the assets used in this particular project.

### Reason of Upload
For educational purposes. I am currently studying the CoronaLabs' Corona SDK (*with a friend of mine*) by reading their documentation and apply what I've learned by developing simple projects like this one. We're hoping that one day we could make our ideas into a game possible. So far, we're trying Corona and see if this one will be our preferred kit to develop our future indie projects.

You can get their SDK [here](https://coronalabs.com/). It's based on Lua scripting language and it's absolutely free.  

## You can read more about image sheets here:
