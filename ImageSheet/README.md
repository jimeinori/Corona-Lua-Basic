# Image Sheet Project
This is an example project I made to show how image sheets work in Corona.

### Disclaimer
I don't own any of the assets used in this particular project.

### Reason of Upload
For educational purposes. I am currently studying the CoronaLabs' Corona SDK by reading their documentation and apply what I've learned by developing simple projects like this one. 

You can get their SDK [here](https://coronalabs.com/). It's based Lua scripting language and it's absolutely free.  

## You can read more about image sheets here: 
* [CoronaLabs DisplayObjects](https://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/media/displayObjects/index.html) - includes properties and methods for images, text, shapes, etc.
* [CoronaLabs Documentation](https://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/media/imageSheets/index.html) - includes overview and setup.
